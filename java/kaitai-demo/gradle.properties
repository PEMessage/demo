# With cache enable, we meet this problem
#     * What went wrong:
#     Could not evaluate onlyIf predicate for task ':app:kaitai'.
#     > Could not evaluate spec for 'Task satisfies onlyIf closure'.
# Seem like same problem like https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/issues/2449
# But could pass built with `./gradlew --no-configuration-cache build`
