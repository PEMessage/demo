# CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package):
#   By not providing "Findhelloworld.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
#   has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
#   "helloworld", but CMake did not find one.

#   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "helloworld" with
#   any of the following names:

#     helloworldConfig.cmake
#     helloworld-config.cmake

#   Add the installation prefix of "helloworld" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
#   "helloworld_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
#   "helloworld" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
#   been installed.
